# Summary
Analyze fantasy stats about your league using the Yahoo Fantasy API, comparing mean, median, and standard deviation across all teams in the league.

Start by updating `oauth2_template.json` to use your own API keys, which can be acquired by creating an application in the [Yahoo Developer Console](https://developer.yahoo.com/).

Then, run the script locally using `python yahoo_script.py`. Allow the necessary access to your league information and continue.
